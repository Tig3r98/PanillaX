# PanillaX
PanillaX (the name) is a combination of the word Packet and Vanilla (as in Vanilla Minecraft).

PanillaX is a fork of [Panilla](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/65694/) by ds58 that only supports recent Paper servers and is easier to compile.

- Additional "AttributeModifiers" on items (eg. Speed)

Currently, PanillaX supports Paper 1.21.4 to 1.21.10

**This fork does NOT support CraftBukkit/Spigot**. It supports Paper derivatives (Purpur, etc.) including Folia.
